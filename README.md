# Static Documentation Site with PyScript
A generic example of how to use PyScript in your documentation with Static Site hosting. The site content itself can be found in [public/index.html][https://github.com/JeffersGlass/pyscript-docs-demo-S3/blob/main/index.html]

## Live Site

## Usage/Deployment

The live demo above is hosted on an S3 bucket using static site hosting, though any generically-accessible static host would work. If you want to re-use the GitHub actions that automatically upload this site to S3, you will need to configure your secrets appropriately for your own S3 bucket.
